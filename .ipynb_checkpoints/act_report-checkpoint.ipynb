    "Have you ever heard the quote in the title,\"They are Good Dogs of Brent\"?, which are widely used in memes to cover people who take issue about the WeDogRate ranking system. What happened in their system is, numerator is far far bigger than the denominator. Yes, you're not heard it wrong, that was their rating system. Even the ratings reach unreasonable numbers. However, this has become a habitual utilization for @dog_rates when determining the rating of their dogs. Interesting right?\n",

    ">WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though?
